<!-- ASO Notes (Grok, Jan 2026):
- Finance apps rank on trust signals — "offline" in subtitle differentiates
- Don't repeat title/subtitle words in keywords (auto-indexed)
- Screenshots should show reminders, calendar view, spending charts, offline mode
- Icon should feel secure/professional (locks, calendars, charts)
- Localize screenshots with local currencies and date formats
- Use promotional text for seasonal/new feature highlights
- Seed in r/personalfinance, YNAB groups
- Push hotfix fast if any crash reports — Finance users abandon quickly
